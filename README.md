# Project: Flight Booker

A typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

This project require you seed your database, so I used my db/seeds.rb file
to write the code necessary to populate Airports and Flights.
